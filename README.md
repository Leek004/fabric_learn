### Module 4, Working with delta table
Here are the key things I learned during my study session:

- 1️⃣ Explored the functionalities of Delta Lake and how it enables SQL-based data manipulation semantics within a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse.
- 2️⃣ Discovered the benefits of Delta tables, including support for ACID transactions, data versioning, and seamless streaming of data through the Spark Structured Streaming API.
- 3️⃣ Learned the process of creating managed or external tables from Spark DataFrames using either Spark SQL or the DeltaTable API.
- 4️⃣ Gained hands-on experience in querying and modifying Delta tables using PySpark, SQL, or the Delta API.
- 5️⃣ Explored how Delta tables can be used as a source or sink for streaming data through the Spark Structured Streaming API.
- 6️⃣ Practiced all the new concepts in a notebook within the data engineering workload
